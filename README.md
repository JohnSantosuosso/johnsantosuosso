Hi! I'm John Santosuosso, software engineer and lifelong learner.

I primarily build in Ruby on Rails, with an active interest in learning new and emerging web frameworks. I love collaborative spaces where I can exercise my technical and communication skills to create innovative and scalable solutions.

Prior to working as a software engineer, I served as an IT specialist for a large public school district outside Washington DC.

In my free time, I am evolving my knowledge of JavaScript and Data Structures/Algorithms while continuing to strive towards writing cleaner and more succinct Ruby.

I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and collaborate.  Let's connect!
