I'm John Santosuosso, former IT specialist, high school teacher, and coach. My journey began several years ago when I was teaching high school and my supervisor informed me that I would be teaching a programming class in the upcoming year. With no prior coding experience, I somehow made it through the year by relying heavily on the teachers' guides. That experience exposed me to a world I never knew existed.

Soon after that, I left teaching to embrace my newfound passion for technology and took a job as an IT support specialist for the school system I worked for. Although I enjoyed managing servers, reimaging machines, diagnosing network issues, and helping students when their laptop keys went missing(too many times to count), I yearned for an opportunity create applications.

I enrolled at Turing School of Software and Design in March 2022 on the recommendation of a close friend who had previously worked with Turing graduates at several startups.

I'm currently working on learning Ruby on Rails. I'm always grateful for feedback, collaborative opportunities, and/or mentorship on anything software development-related.  In addition to my current studies, I am also interested in cybersecurity and its overlap with web development.
