I'm John Santosuosso, former IT support specialist, high school teacher, and coach. My journey started several years ago when I developed a passion for computers and technology.

I began taking computer hardware and networking classes in the evenings and eventually learned enough to land a job as an IT support specialist. After several years, I wanted to build web applications, so I went back to school to learn how.

I value collaboration, communication, and transparency. I take pride in working hard and believe strongly in the 'growth mindset' concept. I am grateful for opportunities to connect, collaborate, and grow.
