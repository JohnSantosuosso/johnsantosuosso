**"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships." --Michael Jordan**

I'm John Santosuosso, a former IT specialist, high school teacher, and coach.  My coding journey began several years back when I was a high school business teacher and my supervisor informed me I'd be teaching a programming course in the upcoming year.  With no prior coding experience, I somehow made it through the year by relying heavily on the teachers' guides.  That teaching experience exposed me to a world I never knew existed.

Soon after that experience, I left teaching to take an opportunity providing IT support for the school district I worked for.  Although I enjoyed managing servers, reimaging machines, diagnosing network issues, and helping students when their laptop keys went missing(too many times to count), I yearned for the opportunity write software.

I enrolled at Turing School of Software and Design in May 2022 on the recommendation of a close friend who had previously worked with Turing graduates at several startups.

I'm currently working on learning Ruby on Rails.  I'm always looking for feedback, collaboration, and/or mentorship on anything related to software development--whether it be feedback on code, pair programming sessions, or anything that promotes learning and growth.

Oh and by the way, I chose that quote at the top because that's a core belief of mine.  Whether it's NBA championships or pushing a new feature to production--it's a team game and I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help the team succeed.
