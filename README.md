I'm John Santosuosso--team-player, lifelong learner, and web developer.

Currently, I build web applications using Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, and jQuery.  I work within an Agile framework to deliver TDD-focused solutions.  I embrace teamwork and communication while welcoming opportunities to challenge myself daily.

Prior to my current role, I served as an IT specialist for a large public school district outside Washington DC.

I have also worked as a public school teacher where I focused on building strong relationships through trust and communication.
