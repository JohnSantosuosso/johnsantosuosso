I am John Santosuosso, web developer, IT professional, and lifelong learner.

Prior to building web applications, I served as an IT specialist at a large public high school located outside Washington DC.  I managed support services for all IT infrastructure and successfully led the school's transition into the world of digital learning and instruction.

I have also worked as a public school teacher where I built strong relationships through trust and communication.

I am currently building full stack apps, primarily within the RoR framework.  I am always looking for opportunities to learn, grow, collaborate, and evolve.
