I'm John Santosuosso, software engineer and lifelong learner.

I enjoy writing clean code, debugging complex issues, and creating thorough documentation.

My other interests include AWS, Cybersecurity, and full-stack development.

Prior to working as a software engineer, I worked as an IT specialist for one of the largest public school systems in the United States.  I have also taught programming and personal finance courses to high school students.

I value collaboration, communication, honesty, and adaptability. Let's connect!
